There are no records of her origin, but her owner said she had been imported from Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) during the war. Although this story gives the breed its name, genetic tests have suggested Abys originated from the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, brought to Europe by British and Dutch traders.They were first imported to the U.S. in 1900, but a breeding program wasn\u2019t implemented until the 1930s when more Abyssinians were imported from Britain. Only a dozen or so of the cats survived the decimation of World War II in Europe, but thanks to their import to the U.S., the breed bounced back and has steadily grown in popularity.Some call Abys \u201cCats from the Blue Nile\u201d, believing they\u2019re the sacred cat of Egyptian Pharaohs.Others believe the breed was created in Britain by crossing silver and brown tabbies with \u201cticked\u201d coats.The Somali is a longhaired Abyssinian."

Manx can have short or long coats. Longhaired Manx are called Cymric in some cat associations.Although their origin isn\u2019t entirely known, records date the Manx to 1750 or later. The breed may have originated on the Isle of Man off the coast of Britain, or a tailless cat may have hitched a ride on a ship to the island, spreading her genes upon her arrival.The island became known for the tailless cats, which is how they got their name. It was one of the first cats represented at some of the first shows held in Great Britain and was one of the founding breeds of the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) in 1906. It wasn\u2019t recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA) until 1979 and is now recognized by many associations.The Manx is the only cat bred to be tail-free.A genetic mutation is the cause of their tailless trait, which was intensified by the breed\u2019s isolation and inbreeding.Only rumpies and risers are permitted in the show ring."

The American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) and The International Cat Association (TICA) also recognized the breed.Ragdolls aren\u2019t bred with any other breeds.These felines get their name from the way they collapse limply into the arms of anyone holding them.Ann Baker, the breeder credited with their origin, made outlandish claims about the Ragdoll, including influence from aliens, CIA experiments and infusions of human genes."

    "description": "The Russian Blue is gentle, quiet and even shy around strangers, but she\u2019s affectionate and loyal toward her people. She\u2019ll follow you around and even ride on your shoulder.She can entertain herself while home alone but loves to play games of fetch with her people.

    "lifespan": "10 to 15 years",
    "colors": "Although Russian Blues have gray coats, in cat shows, this color is referred to as blue. The tips of their fur are silver, so her coat glistens in the light.",
    "did_you_know": "The Russian Blue has a unique body type. It\u2019s known as \u201csemi-foreign\u201d and is in between the short and compact-bodied breeds like the Persian and angular breeds like the Siamese. She has a medium-sized, wedge-shaped head with large, pointed ears. Her round, wide-set green eyes are stunning, and her long neck and firm, muscular body is covered with a short, thick and plush double coat.The precise origins of the breed are unknown, but many believe these cats hail from Russia based on their warm double coat. The Russian Blue likely arrived in England and Europe in the mid-1800s on boats from the continent. They were first shown in 1875 in London, competing with other blue cats. In 1912, however, they were given their own competition class.After World War II, English and Scandinavian breeders worked to revive the breed through outcrossing with similar breeds like blue British Shorthairs and blue point Siamese. North American breeders later imported Russian Blues of both varieties to achieve the best features of each.Some Russian Blue kittens are born with a hint of stripes, known as a \u201cghost stripes\u201d. These stripes are a nod to the tabby gene all cats carry, though they usually fade with age.The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) only accepts Russian Blues with blue coats, but other associations accept them in other colors, including white and black.Some people believe the breed descended from cats of the Russian Czars.They\u2019re sometimes called \u201cArchangel Cats\u201d after their point of origin in the Archangel Isles."

Savannah Cats are characterized by their long, slender necks, triangular heads and large, wide ears that sit on top of their heads. They also have longer-than-average legs.The Savannah Cat breed is a crossbreed of a domestic cat with an African Serval. The first kitten, named \u201cSavannah\u201d, was born on April 7, 1986 and the first generation possessed traits of both domestic cats and African Servals. They had the Serval\u2019s size but the tameness of a domestic cat. In 2012, The International Cat Association (TICA) accepted the Savannah Cat as an official breed.The Savannah Cat\u2019s back legs are slightly longer than her front legs.It takes approximately 3 years for her to fully mature and reach adult size.Savannahs are excellent jumpers.

    "lifespan": "11 to 15 years",
    "colors": "The dense, plush and soft coat of the Scottish Fold comes in a full range of colors and patterns, including solid, tabby and more. Their coat color often dictates their eye color. For example, a white Fold will have blue eyes, whereas a red or brown tabby may have copper-colored eyes.",
    "did_you_know": "A natural genetic mutation creates the unique folded ears for which Scottish Folds are known, but their ears work just as well as any other cat\u2019s. They\u2019re often described as resembling an owl. The ear folds range in appearance from a loose, single fold to tighter double and triple folds, which are closer to the head. Their folded ears may also appear perked. The Scottish Fold has a round face, round eyes and a round body.Every Scottish Fold can trace her heritage back to a barn cat named \u201cSusie\u201d. She was a white cat with unique, folded ears, working as a mouser in a barn in the Tayside region of Scotland. She got the attention of William Ross, a shepherd, in 1961. He was given one of Susie\u2019s kittens and named her \u201cSnooks\u201d.When Snooks eventually had kittens, one of the males was bred with a British Shorthair, which began the breed\u2019s development. The mutated gene that results in the folded ears is dominant, so it produces the trademark ear folds about 50 percent of the time. In addition to this gene, Susie also passed down a gene for long hair. Longhaired cats are known as \u201cHighland Folds\u201d with some cat associations.Scottish Folds weren\u2019t imported to the United States until the Early 1970s. By the mid 70s, they were recognized by most cat associations throughout North America.Scottish Folds were first known as \u201clop-eared cats\u201d.They are not recognized as a breed in Scotland due to concerns about an increased risk of ear infections and deafness.Kittens are born with straight ears and the folds appear around 3 weeks of age. About 50 percent of a litter will have folded ears.Only Folds with folded ears are permitted in show rings."
